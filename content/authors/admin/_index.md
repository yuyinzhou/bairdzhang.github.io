I am a 4-th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at the Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of [Prof. Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). Currently, I am a member of [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](http://ccvl.jhu.edu). Before that, I received my M.S. degree from [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/), and B.S. degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology).
